This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the project ##
This project is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app "create-react-app"). Here the version of the scripts in the `package.json` file is changed.

Original version
```javascript
 "react-scripts": "3.0.1"
```
My version
```javascript
 "react-scripts": "2.1.8"
```

1. Install these files to get started.
2. Сhange the name of your project to your folder name.

`package.json`
```javascript
 "name": "your-project-name"
```
3. Navigate to this folder and install all the packages.
```javascript
npm install   /  yarn install
```
4. After installation is complete, start your project.
```javascript
npm start  /  yarn start
```
### The reasons ###
Making these changes made me think that after the release of the last version of the application `Create React App 3` I could not start the application.

I got the following error in the console:
![Console errors](https://scontent-arn2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/59850255_1601679769969756_8402260648766996480_n.png?_nc_cat=105&_nc_ht=scontent-arn2-1.xx&oh=8cefe071db087d3f23fabb1f88c6a846&oe=5D74B8AB "errors in the console when the application starts" )

After studying the solution to this problem, I wrote my recommendations based on the experience of other users. I express my deep gratitude and dissatisfaction with the developers of Facebook for the release of the unfinished application in release.
